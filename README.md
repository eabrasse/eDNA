This file contains all of Elizabeth Brasseale's code written for the Marine Mammal eDNA MURI project, Module 1, analyzing the transport of eDNA away from a small population of non-native dolphins in a branch of Puget Sound, WA.
Originally I was going to put a more edited version of this up, but I decided to throw everything in here just in case I didn't accurately predict what future users needed. This is meant to be archival, rather than a polished product.

I will be adding "paper trail" notes to explain which of these codes and which data went into main project products:
1. "Marine eDNA production and Loss Mechanisms" paper (submitted to JGR Oceans 7/25/2024) - recorded in ESP_papertrail.docx.
2. "October/June sampling forecasting and hindcasting", might be a paper, but for now it's not. As of 12/13/2024, documentation is "in progress" and not live yet.
3. Miscellaneous, including an ill-advised stab at metabarcoding analysis that I hoped would inform or supplement the ESP paper. As of 12/13/2024, documentation is not yet live.
